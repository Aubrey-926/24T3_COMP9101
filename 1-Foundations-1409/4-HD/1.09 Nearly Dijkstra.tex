\begin{question}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a directed and weighted graph, where $\lvert V \rvert = n$ and $\lvert E \rvert = m$. Additionally, you know that {\em exactly} one edge in $G$ has negative weight and you also know that there are no negative cycles. We want to find the shortest path between two vertices, $s$ and $t$, in $G$. Given such a graph $G$ and two vertices $s, t \in V$, describe an $O(m \log n)$ algorithm to return the shortest path from $s$ to $t$.
\end{question}

\begin{rubric}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide an algorithm that finds the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ in $G$.
    \item Justify the algorithm's correctness. You can assume the correctness of established shortest path algorithms (i.e Dijkstra's algorithm).
    \item Justify the algorithm's $O(m\log n)$ complexity.
\end{itemize}
Expected length: Half a page.
