% The original contents of this file and hello.tex are all comments and will be ignored during compilation.

% Input the examples on pages 9 to 11 of the task sheet, to build up to the second deliverable of this task.
% Don't copy and paste from the PDF; this will add extraneous spaces and newlines.
% You should instead copy and paste from the source code of the task sheet (1.01 Hello, World!.tex), or retype the code.

% When you've completed the subtask at the end of page 9:
% - build the PDF (e.g. using the 'Recompile' button on Overleaf),
% - download the PDF (download icon is slightly to the right of 'Recompile')
%   - optionally, rename the PDF; by default it will be named after this Overleaf project, but math.pdf might be a more appropriate name
% - download the .tex source code (click the three dots next to the selected filename in the left panel and then click 'Download', or copy and paste the contents to a blank file on your local filesystem).

% Now you can update the task status in Formatif to 'Ready for Feedback', and follow the prompts to upload 'hello.pdf', 'hello.tex', 'math.pdf' and 'math.tex' in that order.
