% The original contents of this file and math.tex are all comments and will be ignored during compilation.

% Input the examples on pages 2 to 7 of the task sheet, to build up to the first deliverable of this task.
% Don't copy and paste from the PDF, as this will add extraneous spaces and newlines.
% You should instead copy and paste from the source code of the task sheet (1.01 Hello, World!.tex), or retype the code.

% When you've completed the subtask at the end of page 7:
% - build the PDF (e.g. using the 'Recompile' button on Overleaf),
% - download the PDF (download icon is slightly to the right of 'Recompile')
%   - optionally, rename the PDF; by default it will be named after this Overleaf project, but hello.pdf might be a more appropriate name
% - download the .tex source code (click the three dots next to the selected filename in the left panel and then click 'Download', or copy and paste the contents to a blank file on your local filesystem).

% You'll also need to complete the second subtask.
